                    "scriptPath": {
                        "value":"@pipeline().parameters.script",
                        "type": "Expression"
                    },
                    "scriptLinkedService": {
                        "referenceName": "Blob-Connection",
                        "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
                    }

                    "script" : "master.dbo.sp_lineitems()"

        "parameters":{
            "script" : { "type": "String" }
        }

a correct scriptPath and scriptLinkedService are specified in action definition.
This can be checked on UI be clicking "Edit" on "Script" tab: script shows up.

However triggering pipeline always fails with the following error:
{
    "errorCode": "2103",
    "message": "ScriptPath should not be null",
    "failureType": "UserError",
    "target": "U-SQL"
}
